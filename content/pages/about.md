## Who are we?

We are simple citizens, mostly french people, trying to produce a new economic value nammed « libre currency », of digital form, and respecting the principles established by the [Relative Theory of Money (RTM)](http://en.trm.creationmonetaire.info/)

There is currently no official organization behind Duniter, even if the project is supported bien the *Art et Zerty* company, French EURL owned by the Duniter software founder Cédric Moreau a.k.a *cgeek*, and owning the Duniter tradmark in France.

If the project takes off on long term, the creation of a Foundation is already considered by its initiators. The trademark would then be transfered to the Foundation.
