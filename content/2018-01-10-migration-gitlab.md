In 2018, we migrate our Duniter code repositories to [Gitlab](https://git.duniter.org). 
From now on, we no longer depend on a private platform to publish our releases and maintain our issues.

Everything has been migrated: issues, Git repositories, and even user accounts! 
It is also possible to connect using Github logins. 

You will find in particular the following repositories : 

The repository of [Duniter Typescript](https://git.duniter.org/nodes/typescript/)
The deposit of [Duniter Rust](https://git.repository.org/nodes/rust/)
The repository of [Cesium](https://git.duniter.org/clients/cesium)

As on Github, if you want to contribute, you can fork the project, create issues, etc. I
  
We are also taking advantage of this migration to **change the way we develop the protocol.** 
We have set up a [protocol RFC repository](https://git.duniter.org/nodes/common/doc).
Proposals for improvements and changes to the protocol are managed through [merge requests](https://git.duniter.org/nodes/common/doc/merge_requests)
on the repository.
